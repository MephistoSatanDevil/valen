		Section I. About
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Valen NPC Mod adds the following component to BGII: 

(01) Valen (of Bodhi's hold) becomes an NPC who can join your party.
        She's a Chaotic Evil Vampire fighter/thief. 
        She has quite a bit of interjection dialogue in SoA. 
        She won't get along with Aerie, Anomen, Keldorn or Mazzy.
        Her innate vampiric powers increase with experience. 
        One Valen-specific challenge. 
        
Yep, that's right -- no Valen-specific quests. We can't all be Solaufein.
This one's just for fun and a change of pace. :-) Didn't you ever want to
play an evil monster in an AD&D campaign? 


		Section II. Installation
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII is required. ToB is currently required. The Valen Mod will
install correctly over (or under or without) the Ascension Mod. It should
work fine with any WeiDU mod. See the webpage for details. 

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-Valen.exe". 

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available:
  American English
  French translation by Ly Meng, Archange de la Redemption and
                     by Laurent Duvernet, artemidore@caramail.com
                     by Cocobard, bardbards@planetis.com
  Spanish translation by Clan REO 
  German translation by Sebastian de Waal and Thalantyr and 
    Tanis Eichenblatt and Falk Swoboda
  Polish translation by Grzesiek Miazga
  Italian translation by Al17 e Kelvan, http://rtt.altervista.org
  Russian translation by Aerie.ru, http://aerie.ru 
  Japanese translation by ironthrone
  Chinese translation by kalabaka and yun395

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "Setup-Valen.exe". 

The components should install correctly for international players who have
both DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK. 

NOTE: You may also want to install the "no drow avatars" component of the
Ease-of-Use mod when you install Valen, or a bug in BG2 may cause her to
"stutter" (walk, stop, walk, stop) in the Underdark. This bug actually
bites anyone who can regenerate. 


		Section III. Valen 
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valen will be offered to you as a joinable NPC if you side with Bodhi in
Chapter 2. She'll be hanging around the graveyard after you accept Bodhi's
offer. Bodhi now allows pure thieves to side with her (originally she did
not so that you wouldn't mess up the thief stronghold). 

Valen will leave the party if Anomen, Aerie, Keldorn or Mazzy are ever in
it. Well, non-CN Anomen anyway. What were you expecting? 

Valen cannot touch most holy objects (e.g., Carsomyr, Mace of Disruption)
without being burned. So don't try it. 

Valen can be Turned by Clerics ... even Clerics in your party ... so watch
out. A high-level cleric will blast Valen "right out of the realms". A
high-level evil cleric will control Valen and turn her against your party. 
Repulse Undead will push her away. Valen cannot attack creatures who are
Protected From Undead (via the scroll, for example). Valen is undead and
she counts as such for anything that cares (e.g., Bolt of Glory, Sunray
cast by an enemy, Mace of Disruption, etc.). 

Valen's special armor allows her to survive in the sun without damage ...
but her abilities are sorely reduced. Don't expect her to win any fights
for you outside at high noon. She may have to spend as much as sixty
seconds out of the sun in order to regain her full abilities. 

Valen (like all undead) cannot be "resurrected". If she dies, that's it:
she's gone forever. Don't get her killed. 

If you are playing on an easy difficulty level and her health gets too low
she will try to turn into mist and regenerate. While in this gaseous form
she is immune to almost everything (she will still take some fire damage
and magic damage). However, she will not be able to attack or otherwise do
anything useful for the duration (which decreases as she gains experience). 

Valen will continue to advance as a vampire (in addition to her normal
fighter and thief classes) as she gains experience. Every 1.5 million XP
she gains will improve her undead abilities (e.g., increase her physical
prowess, her regeneration rate, her immunity to weapons, or the effects of
her claws). She will also get better at charming and instilling fear in her
enemies. 

When Valen reaches 2.5M XP some Vampire Hunters will track her down. Watch
out. They won't come while she's in the sun (that would be too evil :-)). 

You may talk to Valen at any time and give her a few simple orders.
  (1) You may ask her to stop trying to hide in shadows all the time. This
  is useful if you want to buff her with spells. You may later ask her to
  hide again.
  (2) You may ask her to stop attacking all visible enemies. You'll miss
  out on the full Valen experience, but some situations call for fine-tuned
  control. You may ask her later to slaugther everything again.
  (3) You may ask her to stop trying to control the minds of her enemies
  (e.g., vampire charm and fear). 
  (4) You may ask her to stop detecting traps. *Despite* what the game
  says, detecting traps does not cause her to leave the shadows early. But
  some people still want to make her stop, so there it is. 
  (5) You may ask her to check her claws. This will cause her to remove all
  of the claws that she is carrying and then reform them based on her
  experience. Use this if you run into some problem where her claws
  disappear. 

Non-Evil priests (aside from some key plot figures like Priestess Demin) 
will turn against your party if they see Valen in it. They will also uses
scrolls to cast spell slike "repulse undead" and "false dawn" against
undead used against them (either from the Animate Dead spell or from Valen
joining your party). Finally, enemy priest will actually (occasionally) try
to Turn (or Command) Undead. 

There is a second component to the Valen mod that allows you to
(optionally) give many creatures protection from level drain and the undead
(as per the scroll). This component makes all golems, elementals, demons,
slimes, mists, planetars and "objects" (like the Shadow Altar) immune to
level drain. In addition, all clerics and paladins (that cannot ever join
the party) have a 50% chance of getting a "protection from undead" scroll
(just like the ones you can buy -- undead like Valen won't be able to
attack them). Most of the opponents in the game are not prepared to deal
with level-draining undead like Valen, so installing this component will
make things both a bit more realistic and a bit harder.

		Section IV. Known Bugs 
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valen's claws are weapons that can be used by a thief with "use any item".
You can also "trick" Valen into making too many claws. They don't go away
when she dies. I don't care. Don't do that if you're role-playing. The old
method where her claws were Valen-only led to too many bugs. 

Valen can be "killed" by intelligence drain (and some other methods) and
she won't "die the final death". Game engine bug.

If Valen is imprisoned, she will die the final death. Sorry, it's a game
engine bug -- they count imprisonment as death. 

When Valen kills a troll, sometimes it comes right back, yada yada. Game
engine bug. Same thing happens if you (the PC) use a level-draining attack.

		Section VI. FAQ (Spoilers)
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: With whom will Valen have interjections (i.e., extra dialogue with
another actor that need not involve the PC)? 

Promenade:      Ribald
Graveyard:      Kamir
Bodhi's Lair:   Antenos, Chore, Fetch, Food, Cohn, Meredath
Trademeet:      Logan Coprith, Khellon
Druid Grove:    Pauden
Windspear:      Samia, Grancor (Wolf Trap), Firkraag
De'Arnise:      Lady Delcia, Delson
Government:     Delon, Amnish Night Guards, Brega
Bridge:         Rose
Umar Hills:     Hiding Valygar
Temple Ruins:   Anath
Sewers:         Roger
Docks:          Aran Linvail
Spellhold:      Imoen, Lonk, Dace, Saemon
Underdark:      Svirfneblin Patrol, Demon Lord, Simyaz
Overland:       Drizzt
Suldenesselar:  Elhan, Demin
Hell:           Wraith Sarevok

Special Note: We did mention that Valen was bloodthirsty, right? You can
expect her to push you into some fights. 


Q: Why is Valen so weak?

A: Get her out of the sun. Innately, she's strong enough to solo the game. 
Of course, so is Keldorn. :-) 


Q: Why does Valen have too many proficiencies? 

A: She doesn't -- as her dialogue reveals, she was originally a
dual-classed character. In BG2, dual-classed characters end up with gobs of
weapon profs. 


Q: Valen should be immune to "hold", but beholder rays keep paralyzing her.

A: In BG2, undead are not immune to the hold from beholder rays (which use
the "hold creature type" opcode), presumably because giving them a blanket
immunity to it would make them immune to "hold undead" type spells. Valen
has the same immunities as other vampires in BG2, so she falls victims to
those rays just as they would. Sorry. 


Q: Valen keeps attacking my enemies even when I have party AI turned off.
What gives? 

A1: She told you in the dialogue (you were reading it, right?) that she had
strong instincts. You can keep her from attacking foes if you watch her
like a hawk and keep her on a short leash ... but otherwise her bloodlust
will come through. Come on, she has to have some disadvantages. 

A2: Talk to her directly and ask her to stop doing that. 


Q: The Vampire Hunters are hanging Valen out to dry. How can I save her?

A: Apparently Valen (or was that Spike?) is hell on wheels, but it's hard
to user her incredible powers in this fight because she cannot target them.
My first suggestion would be to dispel their buffs. After that it's pretty
standard. Note that as Undead Hunters (Paladins) most of them are immune to
level drain. 

A2: Kish offers this advice:

      Phase One [ fighting the hunters in the Underdark, Fanskar is the PC ] :
   As soon as we arrive in the Underdark, Valen starts running toward the
   Earth Elemental Portal. (Boots of Celeritous Stealth.) Edwin Improved
   Hastes Korgan. Korgan Enrages. The others wait for our heroes to appear.
   (I know from the first few tries that any spells Viconia or Fanskar
   tried to cast would be interrupted.) Korgan attacks Van Helsing as soon
   as he appears. Imoen attacks Buffy as soon as she appears. (It doesn't
   matter which one Imoen attacks, as long as it's not Van Helsing, with
   his Physical Mirror.) Viconia casts Elemental Summoning, Fanskar casts
   Righteous Magic, Edwin casts two Mordenkainen's Swords. Phase One ends
   when Valen is at the Earth Elemental Portal (depending on how her mind
   control is working, she may have recruited an Earth Elemental or a
   Kuo-Toa along the way), the four vampire hunters are converging on her,
   and the party is converging on the hunters. The three devas the hunters
   summon are left behind to play with the Mordenkainen's Swords and
   Viconia's elementals. 
      Phase Two
   Korgan and Imoen both attack physically. Korgan picks on Van Helsing
   while Imoen picks on anyone but Van Helsing. (N.B. The Dispel Magic
   ability of a level 13 anti-paladin is completely inadequate for this
   fight, so I quit trying it after a couple times.) Valen occupies herself
   with the Earth Elementals, since she can't see anyone actually involved
   in the main fight, until she's pounded into mist form. It doesn't
   usually take long.  Viconia and the main character target Valen's
   location with Unholy Blights. Edwin does the same, only with
   Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wiltings.  Since an Unholy Blight is enough to send
   any summon hostile, we use no summons here.  Key to this strategy is
   Valen's moment of vulnerability (she's in humanoid form but still
   purple-circled) coinciding with the surviving Undead Hunters being out
   of the fight (Sanctuaried and trying to Heal themselves). Those
   Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wiltings and Unholy Blights are likely to kill the
   Sanctuaried hunters before they can Heal themselves.  Van Helsing is
   always the first to go down.


Q: I do not have ToB but I really want to install Valen anyway.

A: Install Valen and then remove the file override\VALENMST.SPL. The mod
should then "work" (although some aspects, like the vampire hunters, will
be a little strange). However, this is *not supported* and you should not
send me any mail whatsoever about Valen + SoA. 


Q: Valen (or someone else) was permanently blinded by a priestess in
Saradush!

A: That's the spell Nature's Beauty. The blindness lasts forever but can be
removed with Dispel Magic.
